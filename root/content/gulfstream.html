        Ever-evolving development of my personal portfolio site. This is my playground.
        This is where I like to test new ideas, try out new designs, and showcase the
        projects I have been working on.
    </p>
    <p>
        In lieu of social media, I would like for this totake on the role of a constantly
        updated personal journal. I'm not on social media, so I'd like this to be a place
        where people can connect with me, if they so desire.
    </p>

    <h5 class="project-subtitle">Current</h5>
    <p>
        The current version of my site is taking it back to basics. I felt like the previous
        version was a bit too focused on design, so I wanted to pare it down and focus on what
        is currently important to me - development. I also get bored of seeing the same design
        and wanted to look at something more inline with my current aesthetic preferences.
        I used CSS Grid and Flexbox for the main layout of the site. I incorporated
        <a href="signal.html" class="link">Signal</a> for the templating engine. I focused
        on white space and clean typography, because, well, that's what I'm into. I wanted
        an easy to navigate site that shows off my work and my style.

    <h5 class="project-subtitle">June, 2019</h5>
    <p>The previous version of my site added a few new details. The design was similar to the the
        version before it, but the functionality and usability got some upgrades. I used JavaScript
        to swap the images based on the screen width. I changed the style of the homepage upon
        screen resizing. I added a "What's new" page that I plan to use as a journal.

    <h5 class="project-subtitle">Early 2019</h5>
    <p>In 2019, I was in the mood for a total overhaul, so I took things in a whole new direction.
        I made the site brighter, cleaner, and better organized. I found a portfolio site that I really
        liked, and wanted to mimic their overall look. To accomplish this, I used a blocky grid layout
        with a fully responsive portfolio grid finally put in place.</p>

    <h5 class="project-subtitle">2018</h5>
    <p>After a few years of learning new tricks, my site needed an update. I kept the same general feel,
        but wanted to use a better grid layout, and a more responsive design. I revamped the layout with
        Bootstrap, which was a much more efficient alternative to what I had done previously.
    </p>

    <h5 class="project-subtitle">2014</h5>
    <p>Completed as my first serious project, this version was created to showcase my portfolio of
        graphic design and artwork. I used basic HTML and CSS to build this site.
