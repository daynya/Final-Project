        Gulf Stream contacted me with need of a clean and elegant brochure site to inform
        clients of the company history and reputation. The beautiful photography and minimal
        text keep the site on track without being distracting.

        They wanted to incorporate a video into the homepage, and a client login to access
        restricted documents. Working with a Vimeo subscription, we were able to embed their video
        and customize it to their specifications.

        As I do with all recent projects, I built this site using <a href="signal.html" class="link">Signal</a>
        for the templating engine. I also used Bootstrap for the grid here. They needed many modals included
        for the bios of their team, and Boostrap offers an easy tool for this task.
