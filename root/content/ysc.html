    <p>
        Yoga Shala Charlotte holds teacher training classes twice per year.
        The owner had a stack of old diagrams and notes, but was in desperate
        need of an organized manual to hand out to students in the training.

        The manul consists of some old materials, as well as photos which I 
        edited of each pose, and worksheets for the instructors to complete.
        I complete updates to the manual each training, including a few total
        transformations to the layout and content.
