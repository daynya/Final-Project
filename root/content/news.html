                I just built a JavaScript memory game. <a href="design/memory.html" class="link">Click here to see!</a>

                I'm currently spending a lot of headspace on helping a friend update their WordPress site.
                Time outside of that is dedicated to reconfiguring my own site, yet again!
                I'm also slowly picking away at a very in-depth React class. I like to take lots of breaks from that. :)

                Here are a few of the recent iterations of my site (reverse chronological order). It's bound to change 
                again soon! You can see snapshots of the previous versions on my <a href="webdesign.html" class="link">web design page.</a>

                I'm wrapping up a really neat logo design. I can't post that quite yet, 
                but it's for a really cool company that I am stoked to be helping with their design/branding efforts.

                When I'm not at my computer (not often, lately), I'm working on this piece on cavnas.
                I'm really excited to see how it turns out. It's firey and full of summer.
