    <p>Oil on chipboard</p>
    <p>5" x 7"</p>
    <p>
        This was a timed landscape session.
        This commercial chipboard is suitable for small, quick paintings. 
        I used quick, abstract marks to lay out this landscape. This leaves plenty of negative space through which the natural board color shows, making a great foreground.
