        The second in my ongoing Nebula Series. I stepped up the scale on this piece. The subject matter lends itself well to large canvases. 
        This is an effort to connect, on a deep level, to the stardust contained within us all. 
        The mystery and beauty that the nebula offers mirrors the depths of the same contained within us, as humans living in a universe of star matter.
        I did a quick color study before prodeeding into this giant piece, shown below.
