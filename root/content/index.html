        My name is Daynya Quigley, and I am a developer from Charlotte, NC.
        I have a passion for clean, elegant solutions. I want to help rid
        the world of distracting noise, and restore a balance of function 
        and aesthetics. I love the victory of problem-solving and learning
        new tricks.
