            <h4>
                Hi, I'm Daynya.
            </h4>
            <p>
                I'm delighted that you're here.
                I want to help you design better things.
            </p>

                Who I am:
            </h5>
            <p>
                A collection of energy currently inhabiting a human body. 
                A living, breathing, being, learning how to navigate the twists and turns of living on this planet. 
                Straddling the line between nature and technology, thriving off of the challenge to find a harmonious balance. 
                Tuning in to nature, tuning out of distractions. Channeling my inner weirdo.
            </p>
            <h5>
                What I do:
            </h5>
            <p>
                I design and build things for the internet, as well as printed materials. I want to help you clear the clutter, 
                so that your message can shine. I believe in the power that comes from a clean, functional design solution. 
                I also like to paint, and make other crafty arts with my hands.
            </p>
            <h5>
                What I love:
            </h5>
            <p>
                Living life on my own terms, vegetables, big picture thinking, animals, solving tough problems, meditating, 
                lifting heavy ass weights, sunshine, speaking up, sarcasm, talking, coffee, the 90s, tattoos, helping other people grow.
           </p>
