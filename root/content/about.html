        Hi, I'm Daynya.
    </h1>
    <h3>
        I'm delighted that you're here.
        Together, I hope we can make better things.
    </h3>
    <h4>
        Who I am:
    </h4>
    <p>
        A collection of energy currently inhabiting a human body. 
        A living, breathing being, learning how to navigate the twists
        and turns of living on this planet. Straddling the line between
        nature and technology, thriving off of the challenge to find a
        harmonious balance. Tuning in to nature, tuning out of distractions.
        Channeling my inner weirdo.
    </p>
    <h4>
        What I do:
    </h4>
    <p>
        I design and build things for the internet. I want to help you
        clear the clutter, so that your message can shine. I believe in
        the power that comes from a clean, functional design solution.
        My foundation is built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In my free
        time, I immerse myself in learning the ever-evolving technology 
        of this field. I'm currently learning SASS, React,  WordPress, 
        and diving deeper into UX design. It is important to me to build 
        a strong development community, and to help others learn and grow 
        alongside of me. As such, I am regularly involved in local meetups
        and giving back as much as I am able.
    </p>

    <h4>
        How I got here:
    </h4>
    <p>
        After a formal education and over a decade of experience working 
        in graphic design, I realized that I was stuck. I tried a Front 
        End Web Development course on a lark. Little did I know that I'd
        find a passion in that experiment. I fell in love with the way that 
        development pushed my brain to grow in new and unexpected ways. 
        I had spent most of my life in a box full of limitations, and had
        rarely dared to challenge that. When things were hard, I assumed
        it was because I wasn't smart enough. Development taught me that
        there were plenty of ways to dig into problems and find solutions.
        It may not be easy, in fact, it can get pretty messy, but the feeling 
        of overcoming a challenge that seemed insurmountable got me hooked.
        I have worked at additional skills since my course, and say yes
        to any freelance project that I can get my hands on.
    </p>
    <h4>
        What I love:
    </h4>
    <p>
        Living life on my own terms, vegetables, big picture thinking, 
        animals, solving tough problems, meditating, lifting heavy ass
        weights, sunshine, speaking up, sarcasm, talking, coffee, the 90s,
        tattoos, helping other people grow.
