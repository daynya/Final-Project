            <h4>
                My name is Daynya Quigley, and I am thrilled that you are here.
            </h4>
            <p>
                Are you in need of some clever and clean designs? 
                Perhaps you're in the market for some weird and messy art?
                Just want to have a chat about cats, vegetables, or how 90s music was the best?
                I'm your girl.
            </p>
            <p>
                My background: I grew up in Pittsburgh, and attended La Roche College for Graphic Design.
                I moved to Charlotte, NC in 2007, in pursuit of a fresh start and warmer weather. Spoiler alert: I got both.
                I began my career in print design, and now have over a decade of experience working in print shops of all sizes and types.
                I have learned the ins and outs of the printing industry, so about 5 years ago I began pursuing web design. 
                I took a front end web development course through General Assembly, and fell in love. 
                The way it pushed my brain to solve seemingly unsolvable problems, and challenged me to expand my design repertoire appealed to me.

                I have firmly committed to living outside of my comfort zone. Ever in search of growth, I love a good challenge.
                If you have such a challenge for me, or just want to chat, please get in touch. <a href="mailto:daynya@gmail.com" class="about-link">Click here to send me an email</a>
