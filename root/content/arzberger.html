    <p>
        Arzberger has been handcrafting custom stationery for nearly 100 years.
        Clients write up order forms and fax(!) or email them. After completing some
        market research, I struck out on a quest to update the system. I came up with
        an idea to help modernize this interaction. This would save time and money for
        the company, but more importantly, would make it easier for customers to use.
        I concepted, designed and prototyped an online catalog showcasing the categories,
        products, and information needed to place orders. Ease of use was key on this, as
        the clientele varies widely in age, and many users are not computer savvy.
        I used <a href="signal.html" class="link">Signal</a>, along with Bootstrap
        to assist with this project, as there would be many pages of similar
        content and this is an efficient solution.
    </p>

    <img src="img/arzberger-wedding-detail.png" class="design-main-img border" alt="Arzberger screenshot">
    <p>Here is a snippet of the jQuery I used when building interaction on this page.
        I wanted to have a function where upon clicking an image, the item details would
        populate. The catalog has a lot of crossover between items. Many categories overlap,
        so you can show multiple similar products that have unique details. By implementing
        this solution, a customer isn't bombarded with so many choices up front. They can
        distill their selection, then see the samples, options and pricing that correspond.
        From a design aspect, this keeps things cleaner, but it also bears in mind that
        decision fatigue is real and you don't want to scare off customers with too many
        options out of the gate.

    <pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="language-javascript"> 
            $(document).ready(function(){
                $("#detail-2").hide();
                $("#detail-3").hide();
                $("#thumbnail-1").click(function(){
                    $("#main-image").attr("src", "img/smith18.jpg");
                    $("#detail-1").show();
                    $("#detail-2").hide();
                    $("#detail-3").hide();
                });
                $("#thumbnail-2").click(function(){
                    $("#main-image").attr("src", "img/mcguire.jpg");
                    $("#detail-1").hide();
                    $("#detail-2").show();
                    $("#detail-3").hide();
                });
                $("#thumbnail-3").click(function(){
                    $("#main-image").attr("src", "img/campbell18.jpg");
                    $("#detail-1").hide();
                    $("#detail-2").hide();
                    $("#detail-3").show();
                });
            });
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>The eventual goal with this project is to turn it into an
        online ordering portal. Phase one is finishing out the build
        of the catalog. There will be a universal login for current
        clients to login and access pricing, tools and resources.
        Phase two incorporates an online pricing tool. Currently,
        clients are pricing items themselves off of a paper chart.
        I would like to build a tool that allows user input of a
        quantity, as well as customizations, and it will output
        a price. The third phase moves into an online ordering portal.
        As the catalog builds, I plan to collaborate with other
        developers to assist in tying this portal into the company's
        order entry management tool. To be continued!
