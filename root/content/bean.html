    <p>
        Bean Vegan Cuisine needed a refresh of their outdated website.
        They wanted something low fuss, and easily responsive. They had been working
        with two separate websites, and I offered to help them by building one
        responsive site, accessible from all devices. This was my first project to fully
        dive into Bootstrap. As for the design, it began with a logo makeover.
        Scroll to the bottom for the before and after of that portion of the project.
        I let the new logo design guide me in the look for the new site. I went bright and hip,
        letting the food speak for itself.

    <p>
        I used a basic Bootstrap jumbotron/3 column layout for this site.
        The content was mostly focused on information about the restaurant, and the menu.
        There is a responsive grid of photos at the bottom of the main page, followed
        by their contact info.
    </p>

        Fully responsive, the menu columns collapse into 2 rows, then a single row.
        Nothing fancy, but definitely a perfect project to use Bootstrap.
