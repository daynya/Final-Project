    <h4>Ongoing development of personal website</h4>
    <p>
        Ever-evolving development of my personal portfolio site. In lieu of social media, I would like for this to
        take on the role of a constantly updated personal journal. I'd like to showcase my work, both on and off the computer, 
        as well as give you some insight into what I am up to.
        The current version uses Bootstrap for the grid, <a href="signal.html" class="link">Signal</a>, as well as a little JavaScript.

    <p>The most recent development of my site involves a few new details. There is JavaScript put in place to swap the images based on the 
        screen width. There are changes to the homepage upon screen resizing. I added a "What's new" page that I plan to use as a journal.

    <h5>Early 2019</h5>

    <p>I took things in a whole new direction - brighter, more clean and better organized. I used a blocky grid layout
        to achieve a fun new look, with a fully responsive portfolio grid finally put in place.</p>
    <h5>2018</h5>

    <p>After a few years of learning new tricks, my site needed an update.
        I revamped the layout with Bootstrap, which I had learned a lot with since the last iteration.

    <p>Completed as my first serious project, this version was created to showcase my portfolio of graphic design and artwork.
        I used basic HTML and CSS to build this site.
