    <h4>Website redesign</h4>
    <p>
        Bean Vegan Cuisine needed a refresh of their outdated website. They wanted something low fuss, and easily responsive. 
        This was my first project to fully dive into Bootstrap. As for the design, I went bright and hip, letting the food speak for itself. 
        This project included a logo makeover as well. Sadly, the logo and website design never made their debut, and these have remained mockups.
