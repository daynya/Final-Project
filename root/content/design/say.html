    <h4>Development of personal business site</h4>
    <p>
        This is a work in progress site for a side project of mine. It is built using a static site generator, Signal. Signal is a pre-open source
        experiment that I've had access to. I will continue to update the progress here as the content gets complete and I can fill in the site.
