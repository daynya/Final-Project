    <h4>Building of JavaScript Memory Game</h4>
    <p>
        Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I built a two player memory game. The game rules follow:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each player takes a turn and turns over two cards, one at a time.</li>
        <li>If the cards are not a match, the get turned back over.</li>
        <li>If the cards are a match, they stay flipped.</li>
        <li>If you get a match, you get another turn.</li>
        <li>The player with the most matches wins.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>How I built it</h4>
    <p>
        I started with a standard HTML setup. I included a scoreboard and a gameboard.
        I created a grid of divs which serve as the cards. Each card has an image on the back,
        which is the side you see at the game start. The opposite side of each card has an icon.
        There are currently 16 cards total, and 8 unique icons for 8 matches. That's about it for 
        the HTML!
    </p>
    
    <h4>The Challenges</h4>
    <p>
        This game serves up a handful of challenges, and here is how I tackled some of those.
    </p>
    <h6>Deal the cards</h6>
    <p>
        To shuffle the cards, I created a function that generates a random number between 
        1-16, and then that number gets applied to the "order" style on the card divs to 
        shuffle the order in their array. This is called upon the start of a new game.
    </p>
    <h6>Flip the cards over when clicked</h6>
    <p>
        When a card div is clicked, a function in JavaScript adds a "flip" class to it.
        Each card div has both an image (shared with all other card backs), and an icon.
        The icon is not visible upon loading the game, but when the "flip" class is added,
        it will add a rotation animation, and display the icon on the underside of the card.
        There is also a function built in that prevents further cards from being clicked 
        during the turn.
    </p>
    <h6>Remember where the cards are</h6>
    <P>
        During the game, the array holds the newly shuffled "order". When the game has been won,
        or the New Game button is clicked, the cards are re-shuffled.
    </P>
    <h6>Test for matched cards</h6>
    <p>
        When the flip class is added to two cards, there is a function that tests to see 
        if the dataset on each matches the other. If it does, then the paired match turns
        the color of the player who it is awarded to. Those cards then get disabled from further
        game play, and the score is updated. If the cards are not a match, the "flip" class
        is removed from them, and they are turned back over to remain in play.
    </p>
    <h6>Alternate turns</h6>
    <p>
        In my HTML file, I included a div for each player. One of the player divs has a class
        of "active" added by default. In my JavaScript, if the player has made a match, they
        get another turn. This is done by leaving them in "active" status. If they do not get a 
        match, the active status toggles to the other player. The active player is highlighted
        on the scoreboard at top of the game.
    </p>
    <h6>Calculate a winner</h6>
    <p>
        When all 16 cards have been matched, a function is run to calculate the winner. 
        Whichever player has a greater number of matches, wins. The scoreboard then gets updated
        displaying the winner, or letting you know it's a tie. This flashes for a second, and 
        then the game is reset.
    </p>
    <h6>Start a new game</h6>
    <p>
        When a player has won, or the New Game button has been clicked, the gameboard is reset.
        The scores are reset, and the added classes are removed from all cards.
    </p>
    <h6>Timeouts</h6>
    <p>
        In order to make the game play more smooth, I did have to add a timer to a lot of the
        functions included. I felt this was one of the fun challenges. Adding these in
        definitely improved the user experience of the game. Many were issues that I never
        anticpated having until I ran into them during game play. Some of the timers added are: 
        <ul>
            <li>Displaying the cards for a second before flipping them back over if they aren't a match.</li>
            <li>Allow the cards to finish flipping back over before changing players.</li>
            <li>Allow the second card to diplay before flipping back over.</li>
            <li>Allow the scoreboard to update before changing the display around the active player.</li>
            <li>Allow the cards to finish shuffling before being clickable.</li>
            <li>Allow the card to display the icon when clicked before assigning it a color if it's a match.</li>
            <li>Allow the card to finish updating match color before showing the winner.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        This was a fun exercise for me. I ran into some roadblocks that were a little
        tricky, but it gave me a good opportunity to learn some new tricks.
