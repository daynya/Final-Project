    <p>
        This is a website I am working on for a side project of mine. In another life
        I was a yoga instructor. In yet another one, I was a competitive powerlifter.
        In this life, I realized that these two things benefit each other in a unique way
        and have decided to offer a program that helps bring the wonderful effects of
        yoga to the world of the gym. I'm developing content to populate this site with
        a yoga program, photos, videos, and downloadable guides. As that content gets
        generated, I will update that project, and update it's progress here as well.
    </p>

    <p>
        For the build, I used<a href="signal.html" class="link">Signal</a>, and Bootstrap.
        The main focus is going to be the content.
